            <div class="body"><p>Writing the software to run a blog was a big challenge for me. Not because writing the software itself was challenging, but because I was paralyzed by choice of the best way to do it.</p>

<p>I had a whole list of requirements for the blog website. It had to</p>

<ol>
<li>Support markdown for text input.</li>
<li>Allow me to add posts easily, and edit everything about them.</li>
<li>Be secure, without requiring any constant security updates or ongoing maintenance.</li>
<li>Just work. I didn&rsquo;t want to be constantly fiddling with settings.</li>
<li>Allow me to customize anything about it that I wanted. Colors, themes, etc etc etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>I knew about <em>github pages</em> existing, but wasn&rsquo;t sure the best way to get a site hosted on there. Jekyll was the default that they offered, but seemed too weak to fit most of my needs without lots of customisation. I didn&rsquo;t want to learn to use static site generators that already existed &ndash; they were out there, but it was hard for me to find simple examples that showcased how they worked. So I wrote my own &ldquo;blog engine&rdquo; (bla) in Winter of 2018.</p>

<p>It was fairly simple, but included a few good features: auth for admin users to write posts, a frontend ui for writing posts, and a way to host content on customisable HTML pages. The biggest downside though, was that this was a Go application. It needed to be running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> on a server, and wasn&rsquo;t easily scalable. This would be a big problem for me, since I expected occasional spikes in traffic, while normally very minimal regular visitors. This would mean that I&rsquo;d need to spend a lot of money on a powerful enough server for those unexpected spikes, while it would sit idle for days or weeks without much traffic at all.</p>

<p>I ended up abandoning Bla after that realization, and because I found a platform that fit many of my needs: <a href="https://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a>. This was a fully managed blog site, very minimalist themed (which I like), and allowed for markdown in the posts. It automatically scaled, and cost me $6.00 per month. Not too bad. But it didn&rsquo;t check all of my boxes, and I didn&rsquo;t like how they organized my index page. It was good enough for a while, but eventually I felt unmotivated to write there. It didn&rsquo;t feel like it was <strong>my blog</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, I figured I&rsquo;d make my own static site generator. It would be simple to use, easy to template for, and I could host my entire blog on github pages. This allowed me to hit all 5 of my requirements. I also hadn&rsquo;t written go in a while, so this was a good way to get back into it.</p>
