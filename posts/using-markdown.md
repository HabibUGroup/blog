This is a first post! MMSSG supports all regular markdown stuff. What do you think?! There's a lot that you can do with markdown, mostly stuff that's great for a blog.

You can *italicize* things with `*italicize*`

You can **bold** things with `**bold**`

You can make headers with `#`, `##`, `###`, etc

You can make tables

Header 1 | Header 2
---------|-----------
Thing 1  | Thing 2
Thing 3  | Thing 4

From code like this:

```markdown
Header 1 | Header 2
---------|-----------
Thing 1  | Thing 2
Thing 3  | Thing 4
```
